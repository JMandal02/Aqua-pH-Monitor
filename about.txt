  Signal	       A0
  VCC	               5V
  GND	               GND


3Ô∏è‚É£ Power Supply
Connect your Arduino to a USB cable or an external power source.


üöÄ Uploading the Code
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Download Arduino IDE
   Get the latest Arduino IDE from arduino.cc.
2. Connect Your Arduino
   Plug in your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Code
   Clone or download this repository.
   Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Configure Settings
   Go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno).
   Go to Tools > Port and select the correct COM port.
5. Verify & Upload
   Click Verify (‚úîÔ∏è) to compile the code.
   Click Upload (‚û°Ô∏è) to program the Arduino.
6. Monitor in Action
   Once uploaded, the device will display the pH value on the LCD and print it in the Serial Monitor.


üß© Additional Notes
1. Calibration: Calibrate the pH sensor for accurate readings.
2. Power Supply: Use a reliable power source to avoid interruptions.
3. Troubleshooting: Ensure all connections are secure and check for any loose wires.
